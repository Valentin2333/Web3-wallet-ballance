Web3 Portfolio Tracker



📌 Introduction

Welcome to Web3 Portfolio Tracker, my first mini Web3 project! 🎉

This application allows users to track Ethereum wallet balances, both EOAs and smart contracts, in ETH using Infura as the RPC provider. Users can fetch their balances in real-time and verify them directly on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)

🚀 Features

✅ Fetch Ethereum wallet balances in real-time.

✅ Uses Infura for reliable Ethereum network access.

✅ Outputs ETH balances that can be verified on Etherscan.

✅ Implements address validation for security.

⚙️ How It Works

The user provides an Ethereum wallet address.

The backend fetches the balance using ethers.js and Infura.

The ETH balance is returned in human-readable format.

Users can verify the result on Etherscan.

🛠 Technologies Used

Node.js - Backend API

Express.js - Web framework for routing

ethers.js - Ethereum blockchain interaction

Infura - Ethereum RPC provider

🔮 Next Steps

🚀 Add ERC-20 token balance tracking.

🚀 Expand support for multi-chain tracking, both EVM and non-EVM.
